This is the repository for the EEM paper on quantifying capacity expansion limitations in energy system modelling.

You can find the conference paper here:
https://docs.eem25.pt/SSE%20D3/Quantifying%20renewable%20capacity%20expansion%20limitations%20in%20energy%20system%20modelling%20and%20their%20impact%20on%20future%20hydrogen%20production.pdf

After installing the necessary python packages, this should be able to run directly from the directory.
The complete model is planned to be published in the course of 2025.
